10 Steps to Earning Awesome Grades (While Studying Less)

There is a goat icon on the cover of this book because putting it there made it
easy to start this introduction. Also, goats are hilarious.
Moreover, goats are really smart, and they’d probably get damn good grades if
they stopped yelling long enough to think about goat school.
Enough about goat grades, though - this book is meant to help you improve your
grades.

A couple facts to put out there before we begin:
For most students, my opinion on grades is that they do not need to be perfect.
After you define your goals, you’ll find that your coursework is not a magical
Hogwarts train that will take you to them. It’ll help, but alone it’s inadequate.
Focus on getting good grades while also gaining skills outside of class, building
things, doing extracurriculars, making connections and - yes - making time to
have fun. Even if it’s just playing 10 minutes of Goat Simulator (don’t worry,
that’s the last goat joke).

The main point of this book is to help you earn better grades, but the almost-asimportant
sub-focus is to cut down your study time. It’s my aim here to give you
tools and tactics that help you perform better in less time. There’s a neat little
equation I invented below that explains this a little better.
